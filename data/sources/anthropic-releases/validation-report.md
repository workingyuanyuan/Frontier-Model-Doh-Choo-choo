# Anthropic release-page acquisition validation

- Source: <https://www.anthropic.com/claude-opus-5-5> (published 2026-09-22).
- Evidence: `sha256:1c3bebd841ce19d533bc8cc7d17d1b04f1f214305fc8005ab90c0941b8150600`
- Selected RSC charts: `tuskchartfrontiercode` (25 rows); `tuskchartcursorbench` (20 rows).
- Each selected chart has the expected benchmark/version marker and complete Low, Med, High, Xhigh, and Max rows for every extracted series.
- The plotted y coordinate is retained as a percent score. The x cost/task coordinate is validated but not materialized.
- Explicit CSV effort labels are retained. The chart data does not name a harness, so harness is null.
- The FrontierCode Fable 5.1 Low row is preserved at 52.8% but excluded because Cognition reports 49.82% for the corresponding leaderboard row; re-audit the configuration before including it (<https://cognition.com/frontiercode>).
- Source note preserved in row provenance: Anthropic states that Claude Opus 5.5 figures use adaptive thinking at max effort unless noted; each selected chart row has an explicit effort label. Claude Opus 5.5 was evaluated with production safeguards enabled; when they intervened, cybersecurity tasks were completed by Claude Opus 4.8, and biology and frontier LLM development tasks were completed by Claude Opus 5, which Anthropic says likely lowers these scores. The charts do not state a harness, so harness is unknown.
- This is a vendor-reported partial extraction of two release-page charts; separate organizer results remain separate evidence.

## C6 effort inference — PENDING USER REVIEW

This tagged section is generated deterministically for `anthropic-releases`. Raw `profile.effort` remains unchanged; `productProfile.effort` is the transient product decision. Policy default: `default`.

### Cross-source inferences — PENDING USER REVIEW

- None.

### Unlabelled rows assigned the outside-the-ladder default

- None.
